![screen shot](images/screenshot.png)

Contributions is filled with green on the profile page of GitHub is cool!
keep.grass is an application to let you know the time remaining until 24 hours elapse from the last Activity for developers trying to continue filling out Contributions on GitHub with green *every day without fail*.

## *Notes*

Since GitHub does not seem to disclose detailed specifications as to how Activity will be reflected in Contributions, keep.grass will only show the remaining time based on the date and time of the last Activity, so *estimated* It would be greatly appreciated if you could use it.
